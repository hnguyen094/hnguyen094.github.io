                <h2>The App</h2>
                Guess What? is heads-up mobile game to help the <a class="external" href="https://wall-lab.stanford.edu/" target="_blank"><span style="white-space: nowrap;">[Wall Lab]</span></a> at Stanford learn more about autism. Specifically, users can use the game to teach their kids about emotion recognition, and participants can submit gameplay footage to be used for training machine learning models. These models will hopefully/eventually learn to recognize emotions in children, or even detect early signs of autism.

                <h2>Role: Research Assistant / iOS Mobile Developer</h2>
                <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
                I was tasked with aiding the mobile developer on the iOS side to implement whatever we needed.
                <h3>Accomplishments</h3>
            I fixed 1 bug and added 1 released features to the game; I also tested 2 additional game modes to expand the capabilities of the app.

                <h2>1 Bug</h2>
                <h3>Context</h3>
                If you've never played "Heads Up," it's a game you put on your phone on your forehead and you have to guess what is being displayed by clues that other people are giving you. If it's right, you flick it down; if you want to skip, you flip it up. 
                <h3>Challenge/The Bug</h3>
                The app was using accelerometer data to guess which direction; so, when someone flips it down slowly but then flips it back up quickly, it sometimes thinks that it was flicked up, not down.
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                I implemented the fix to instead use the device's gyroscope and instead checked the orientation of the phone; A tilt down, at any speed, will trigger the correct event. <br>
                Bonus: It was also how Ellen's app worked, so everyone's on the same page on the game's mechanics.

                <h2>1 Feature</h2>
                <h3>Context</h3>
                The app's size previously scaled linearly with the number of images it held, so it's app store size often was huge.
                <h3>Challenge</h3>
                AWS Swift APIs were terribly documented, and there were already existing infrastructures to display the prompts (specifically with public buckets and Cognito.)
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                I was able to utilize the various AWS buckets that the lab was already using and incorporate it into the app. Now, users can dynamically download decks for the buckets as they play without seeing any difference in performance.

            <h2>Game Mode #1: Gather & Scatter</h2>
            <h3>Context</h3>
            After each game, the child's reward is an animated gif of a cartoon character. While this is fun, the lab wanted to explore the possibilities of using AR as a more enticing reward system.
            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            The most challenge aspect here is no one knew what should be made. It would be simple enough to show a 3D model instead of a 2D one; but what would that achieve? Why would this be more enticing? <br>
            I ended up building ontop of one of the default experiences for ARKit to create Gather & Scatter, a completely different game mode that increase caretaker-child interactions through a treasure-map game. Caretaker-child interactions to establish shared experiences, like objects, were shown to be beneficial to children with ASD (citation needed; will link when I find it.) <br>
            <h3>The Game</h3>
            To play, the parent starts out placing 3D toys in their home ("scattering".) They can also just scan the house, and press the randomize button to automatically place the toys everywhere. <br>
            Then, the child would then gather the toys, by finding all of them throughout the house ("gather"). The child can then also place the toys wherever they want in the house, and save those locations so they can find and look at their virtual toys later.

            <h2>Game Mode #2: Humpty Dumpty - Competitive</h2>
            <h3>Context</h3>
            Humpty Dumpty is based on the term "Emotion Guessing Game" (EGG.) The idea was conceptualized by the lab in 2019, and was first implemented by another researcher; it would be a game that also acts as a data labelling tool. 
            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            The original setup: The child guesses at 10 emotions, then passes the phone to the parent. Then, the parent either confirms that the child guessed correctly, or fixes the child's guess with the correct emotion label for that gif. This felt clunky and space-inefficient in landscape mode, which is how we first received the game mode.
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            The lead mobile developer and I sat down to prototype various ideas. We knew that we wanted to make it portrait, as we'll be using a specific Tik Tok challenge that involved emoting to the camera. We also wanted the experience to be more engaging. We eventually came up with a competitive mode: the child and parent would rate the same 10 videos separately at the same time, sitting across from each other (like shown.) We were able to prototype it in a couple weeks, and started doing beta/feasability testing with current participants. With their input, we were able to fix many bugs and the lab gained valuable feedback on where to go from there.
