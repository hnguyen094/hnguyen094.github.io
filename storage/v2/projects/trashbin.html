                <h2>Motivation</h2>
                I started this project in 2019, when small form factor (SFX) computer cases were expensive and inaccessible (and I was broke.) However, as a lover of technology and computers, I knew I had to build my own portable PC. <br>
                Thus, the <b>Trash Bin</b> was born from the

                <h2>Materials Exloration</h2>
                <h3>PLA Plastic</h3>
                When working at Stanford's Tech Desk, I had access to free 3D printing. Intrigued by the idea of a a fully 3D-printed case, I foolishly built a computer case with thermoplastics with low melting temperatures. Parts were warped after a few weeks of use. Only the PSU bracket is still made of PLA.
                <h3>MDF</h3>
                With access to a laser cutter through the Graduate School of Education, I began building more flat, structural parts out of MDF (medium density fiberboards). Despite being heavy, the core has held up the past 3 years with very slight bowing. The case was still only loosely held together by my hopes and dreams. Only the core center piece is made of MDF.
                <h3>Acrylic</h3>
                The top and 1 side panel was made out of acrylic to help keep the case...unique. It turns out, acrylic will crack and bow when exposed to computer heat exhaust. The current case does not utilize acrylic anymore.
                <h3>Aluminum</h3>
                After starting work, I was able to afford aluminum pieces. My goal: build a sturdy case that I can trust to travel with. So I got back to work in my sister's basement gluing and screwing metal together (because I didn't have welding tools.) I underestimated how difficult it'd be to work with metal. The front, back, and edges of the current case is made of aluminum.
