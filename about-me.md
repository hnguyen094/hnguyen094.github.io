# About Me

## Who am I? What am I interested in?

I am a Computer Science graduate from [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/). I studied software systems and HCI, and am passionate about using technology to create (secretly) educational/serious games to faciliate learning and change. My other technical interests include software systems architecture, product design, and mechatronics.

Some of my inspirations include my previous professors [Christina Wodtke](https://eleganthack.com/) and [Camille Utterback](http://camilleutterback.com/). Others include game designers [Nicky Case](https://ncase.me) and [Jenova Chen](http://jenovachen.info/).


## Where am I? Since when?

I quit my full-time job at [Three Space Lab](https://threespacelab.com/) and moved to London, UK in late 2023 to explore what it's like to live in many different cities.

## Why do I do what I do?

I want to help & teach people with technology.
Technology can help people around the world by its universal and scalable nature.
For example, a surgeon can operate on patient miles away and save their lives. A VR experience can help one group of people to empathize with another, changing enemies to humans. If you want to know more about my projects, find them on my [projects](index.html) page.

## Hobbies

These days, when I'm not working full-time on my visionOS apps, you'll find me playing Overwatch 2 or watching TV. I occasionally do indoor bouldering/climbing and love to hike as long as I have good company.
