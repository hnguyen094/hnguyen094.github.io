# About Me

## Who am I? What am I interested in?

I am a Computer Science graduate from [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/). I studied software systems and HCI, and am passionate about using technology to create (secretly) educational/serious games to faciliate learning and change. My other technical interests include software systems architecture, security, product design, and mechatronics.

Some of my inspirations include my previous professors [Christina Wodtke](https://eleganthack.com/) and [Camille Utterback](http://camilleutterback.com/). Others include game designers [Nicky Case](https://ncase.me) and [Jenova Chen](http://jenovachen.info/).


## Where am I? Since when?

I quit my full-time job at [Three Space Lab](https://threespacelab.com/) and moved to London, UK in late 2023 to explore what it's like to live in many different cities. In 2025, I'm exploring opportunities anywhere in the UK and the US. 

## Why do I do what I do?

I want to help & teach people with technology.
Technology can help people around the world by its universal and scalable nature.
For example, a surgeon can operate on patient miles away and save their lives. A VR experience can help one group of people to empathize with another so we can all be in solidarity. If you want to know more about my projects, find them on my [projects](index.html) page.

## Hobbies

**Climbing**. I spent countless hours at the playground when I was small, and the climbing gym felt like a natural progression. I also enjoy being outdoors and hiking with good company. 

**Games**. In no particular order: Overwatch, Inside, Florence, Hungry Hearts Diner, Pokemon, Parable of the Polygons, Half-Life: Alyx, RUMBLE VR, Deep Rock Galatic, Overcooked, Pokemon Adventures: Red Chapter, Neko Atsume: Kitty Collector, Travel Frog, Duet. <br> 
This is an incomplete list.

**Making**. I am obsessed with DIY projects, and feel at home in woodshops, pottery studios, and makerspaces. Currently, one project involves designing my own 'cyberdeck' with custom PCBs in a Apple-retro form-factor. 

I also [sketch](https://www.instagram.com/hung.sketch) (because no time for full pieces) and do some photography with my [Playstation Vita](vita.html).
